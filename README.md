# LP_Variables
This repository is for the Manning Books Live Project, Explore Python Fundamentals 1 - Variables.

In Part 1 I was supposed to just show the behaviour of immutable and mutable variables in Python. I didn't understand that and explained variables point at memory locations. 
So I uploaded Part 2, which is just the same as Part 1 because it explains what is happening.
